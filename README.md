## Description

Build a frontend for the API and add the following:

#### Home page
- Make a GET request to fetch a list of resources from your API.
- Create HTML for each item and display at least 3 properties for each.
- Each item should also display a button or icon. Clicking on this button should toggle the item in and out of an array stored in localStorage.
- There should be a text input on this page that filters the array of results on one of the properties.

#### Favourites page
- This page should fetch the array of items stored in localStorage and display them or display a message that there are no items.
- There should be a “Clear all” button that clears localStorage (or just a specific key in localStorage) and reloads the display. Don’t reload the page, just redraw the HTML.

#### Login page
Add a login form to your frontend that will allow a logged in admin user to perform the following tasks:
- Adding new resources to the API
- Updating resources through an edit form
- Deleting resources
